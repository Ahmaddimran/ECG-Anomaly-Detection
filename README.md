# ECG Anomaly Detection

# Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Utilized ECG-5000
- **Model Architectures**: Trained Autoencoder with reconstruction loss
- **Results**: Achieved out-class MSE Of 
- **Threshold**: Decided Anomaly Threshold based upon 94th Percentile of Reconstruction Error of Normal Samples
- **Pipeline**: Modelled a pipeline for ECG and its reconstruction plot along with Model's Prediction
